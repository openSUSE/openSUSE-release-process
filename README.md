# openSUSE-release-process


**The openSUSE-release-process is a set of task definitions to guide you through a openSUSE Leap release process.**
The process is developed in this git repository, however the tasks are executed in [progress-o-o](https://progress.opensuse.org/projects/opensuse-leap-15-4/issues/gantt).

Tasks are created in progress-o-o by [md2workflow](https://github.com/openSUSE/md2workflow). 
openSUSE Leap and Tumbleweed users can simply install the tool by running `sudo zypper in python3-md2workflow-*`
Use the configuration and follow examples from the [readme](https://github.com/openSUSE/md2workflow](https://github.com/openSUSE/md2workflow#md2workflow)https://github.com/openSUSE/md2workflow#md2workflow)
