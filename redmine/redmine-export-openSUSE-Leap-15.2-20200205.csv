Find a how-to on writing them here: http://en.opensuse.org/openSUSE:Product_highlights_writing

We've learned some lessons during the 12.3 product highlights writing, take these into account:
* do NOT try to be 'complete'. Going through ALL the changelogs of ALL packages with a script and then filtering out the interesting stuff (we did that, yes) is just way too much work.
* Instead, focus on the most important packages, eg look at http://distrowatch.com/table.php?distribution=suse and pick from the packages there.
* Kick the community to add their features to https://en.opensuse.org/openSUSE:Major_features and use that as a major guide. It is the 'start' of the product highlights.
** for 13.1, Michal send scripted mails to packagers who did 'major stuff'. This seems to have worked quite well: https://github.com/openSUSE-Team/features-reminder
* Get the KDE stuff from the KDE announcement, the GNOME stuff from the GNOME announcement, the kernel stuff from kernelnewbies.org and the H kernel archives as soon as you know which versions we'll ship! Put them on the Major_features page so you're ready with that.
* Kick the artwork team: they need to get the final art in in time so the screenshots can be made! It is a blocker, also for the press kit."

Example text below from the 12.3 release:
Hi XXX,

As the openSUSE community manager, I am pleased to provide to you the final version of openSUSE 12.3 for your evaluation in advance of its worldwide release on March 13. openSUSE 12.3 comes only six months after our previous release, which means we are back to our usual eight month cycle (12.2 was delayed by two months). Below is a link to the openSUSE 12.3 GoldMaster (final) for your testing pleasure. Also included is a feature overview and press release. The announcement is embargoed until Wednesday, March 13, 2013 at 14:00 UTC. 

Notable in openSUSE 12.3 is the addition of OpenStack (Folsom) packages as well as the move to MariaDB as default database. MySQL is still a part of our distribution, so not much will change for the average user as both databases have been part of openSUSE for a long time already. 

And there is of course the ARM and ARM 64bit work our ARM team has been doing. We're currently at over 4000 build packages, putting us well ahead of any other Linux distribution supporting ARM's AArch64 architecture. Preview images for installation and testing will be made available when 12.3 is released. The ARM 32bit efforts are progressing too. We plan to release a stable openSUSE 12.3 for ARMv7 shortly after the x86 and x86_64 versions to be released on Wednesday the 13th.

In case you wonder and have followed the controversy, we support UEFI in this release and there's Secure Boot. But, in proper openSUSE fashion, we're not 200% confident about Secure Boot, in part due to the issues with Sony laptops (we will carry the patches making the issue less likely to hit our users). A wiki page is being built on https://en.opensuse.org/openSUSE:UEFI to keep our users informed of our ongoing efforts to solve Secure Boot. 

There will be new SUSE Studio images for 12.3 available on release day. Upgrading existing images/appliances will also be possible on Wednesday, March 13.

http://software.opensuse.org has been building openSUSE 12.3 packages for a while and much software is already available. For example, the just released plasmate 1.0 is already built for 12.3!

I'm quite proud of what our desktop teams have done for this release. See http://news.opensuse.org/?p=15318 if you are interested in a preview. There's an awesome video introducing our default desktop, KDE, made by a volunteer (you won't believe he did that in his free time if you see it).

If you have any questions or would like an interview with someone from the openSUSE team, the wider community, the board or me, just let me know.

Kind regards,
Jos Poortvliet
openSUSE Community Manager

* The headline summarizes that we released our product (""openSUSE released 13.1""), the sub-title has the most important features that our awesome distro delivers. The following paragraph expands on those and leads to the details that follow.
* Those not reading beyond the first paragraph must know the most important news! So, most important info there. Make sure to clearly answer the 5 W's & H in the first paragraph: Who is this about? What is the actual news? When does this happen? Where does this even take place? Why this is news? How is this happening?
* Include details, numbers, facts and quotes.
* 1 page is best, 2 pages absolute maximum.

It is CRUCIAL in writing the press announcement, the openSUSE Leap 42.2 portal wiki page and the news.o.o announcement as well as for the press.

Some marketing rules are applied to this list, as they determine what the press will talk about:
* 3x3: 3 main areas with each 3 main feature improvements. Not a black and white rule but keep the total features under 10 and the area's at 3 or 4.
* First, Best, Only: these are the qualities you are looking for in the features. Otherwise, press won't pick up on them, why bother when openSUSE catches up to the rest of the world?
* Impact on users, Resolving major issues, Relevant today: these are less important but relevant properties. Impactful changes, things that change important problems or things tying into recent events or relevant trends are worth having on the list.

The best way of getting to product highlights is to organize a meet with some technical and non-technical folk. Not just the openSUSE team, include Will, Henne, Andreas Jaeger, possibly people from SUSE Marketing and management (Roland perhaps?). Introduce the goal and the how of it (see bullets above), then go over the feature list, pick the things which are important together.

os-release is currently hacked manually. The real change needs to be in 000package-groups/openSUSE.product.in. It needs to be it needs to be renamed to Leap.product.in:

        <vendor>openSUSE</vendor>
        <name>Leap</name>
        <version>15.2</version>

That has various implications like openSUSE-release.spec renaming to Leap-release.spec with currently unknown consequences to how eg zypp behaves.

The non-oss product also needs to be adopted


TODO list from etherpad so we don't lose it: https://etherpad.nue.suse.com/p/leap_product_rename
openSUSE.product produces a product called ""openSUSE"" from vendor ""openSUSE"". What we actually have are products called ""Leap"" and Tumbleweed"" from vendor ""openSUSE"" though. In order to properly support SCC registration the information OBS has needs to be consistent. Therefore it's desirable to rename the product from openSUSE to Leap.

openSUSE.product.in -> Leap.product.in
openSUSE-release.spec.in -> Leap-release.spec.in

Issues:
    - Quite some packages require openSUSE-release. So there is a compat package that just requires Leap-release.
    - installation-images pulls in openSUSE-release and then fails to resolve deps as the flavor package is missing. So far the flavors were build ignored via prjconf. installation-images also had an extra config to ignore an unresolvable openSUSE-release package. To avoid patching installation-images we just pull in the mini flavor:
        Prefer: Leap-release:Leap-release-mini
     - pkglistgen updating relpkgs will parsing *.product in 000product, but due to the issues below 000product don't have the proper data. Result: old openSUSE release flavor spec file were added back
     - first step of pkglistgen pipe(repochecker) failed due to openSUSE-release package is duplicated. Workaround: installcheck-ignore-duplicated-binaries = openSUSE-release
     - pkglistgen fails in progress due to openSUSE.product.in was renamed however it's required by pkglistgen-locales-from
     - change pkglistgen-locales-from will breaks other stagings and main product build
     - solution: languages list moved to pkglistgen-locale attribute and leave pkglistgen-locales-from empty, thus pkglistgen fetch languages list from an attribute instead of a file
     - remember to update pkglistgen-delete-kiwis-rings and pkglistgen-delete-kiwis-staging otherwise unneeded kiwi file were there
     - update product name in the OSRT:ToTestMnagerConfig - otherwise ttm won't release snapshot to ToTest
     - repository loction needs to update in rsync_opensuse
     - the obs dashboard hardcodes the dvd name so needs to be adjusted src/api/app/models/obs_factory/distribution_strategy_*
     - rsync.pl needs to sync the new product name Leap-dvd5 instead of openSUSE-dvd5
     - NonFree/000release-packages/_aggregate needs to get the right release package
     - rsync.pl for the main repo also needs to sync correct names. The non-oss ftp tree had an inconsistent name though.
     - upgrade tests fail as the openSUSE product vanished and gets replaced by the Leap product. YaST doesnt like that and displays summary in red. https://openqa.opensuse.org/tests/1062080#step/disable_grub_timeout/2
       - needed to add Provides: product() = openSUSE
       - weakremovers handling: http://bugzilla.opensuse.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1155819
       - FIXME: flavor package replacement doesnt work?
         https://github.com/openSUSE/obs-service-product_converter/pull/7
       - baseproduct symlink needs to be taken care of
